# SQL-Injection-Demo
In order to take a closer look at SQL injection attacks, we're going to mount one ourselves. This activity will allow us to mimic a SQL injection attack using a small app of our own creation. The app will consist of a simple log in and a mock user database on the back end that has purposefully been left vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.
